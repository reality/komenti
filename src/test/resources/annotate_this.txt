Apoptotic DNA fragmentation is a key feature of apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is characterized by the activation of endogenous endonucleases, particularly the caspase-3 activated DNase (CAD),[1] with subsequent cleavage of nuclear DNA into internucleosomal fragments of roughly 180 base pairs (bp) and multiples thereof (360, 540 etc.). The apoptotic DNA fragmentation is being used as a marker of apoptosis and for identification of apoptotic cells either via the DNA laddering assay,[2] the TUNEL assay,[3][4] or the by detection of cells with fractional DNA content ("sub G1 cells") on DNA content frequency histograms e.g. as in the Nicoletti assay.[5][6] There is no such thing as apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
